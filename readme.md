# Exploring Methods and Systems of AI

## Genetic Algorithm 🧬
### Task: ✈️
Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?
### Functionality:
- Collecting cities to travel on the map of Ukraine 💙💛
- Storing and loading dataset of points from the MongoDB <img src="./methods-and-systems-of-ai-web/src/img/mongodb.png"  style="height: 1rem"/>
- Tweaking genetic algorithm with different parameters 🤓
- Client can track current state of the server's work and dynamically draw a current shortest path 🖼️
- All statistic stored in MongoDB <img src="./methods-and-systems-of-ai-web/src/img/mongodb.png"  style="height: 1rem"/>
- Server gather statistic and return a line chart on a request 📈
